# Longevity Risk Analysis and Management in Pension Plans

This project explores the analysis and management of **longevity risk** in pension schemes, with a focus on both global insights and local relevance in Kenya. Conducted as part of a final-year actuarial research project, the study applies multiple mortality models, policy evaluations, and scenario analyses to assess how increased life expectancy impacts pension sustainability.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To investigate the growing challenge of longevity risk in pension plans and propose effective strategies for measuring, managing, and mitigating its financial impact.

## 👩‍💻 My Contributions

- Conducted an in-depth **literature review** on behavioral finance, utility theory, and life-cycle modeling in the context of retirement planning.
- Analyzed **Kenya's shifting mortality patterns** and demographic transition trends.
- Applied and validated **mortality models** including:
  - Lee-Carter
  - Cairns-Blake-Dowd (CBD)
  - Gompertz-Makeham
  - Kannisto model
- Performed **scenario and sensitivity analyses** to assess pension liability outcomes under different longevity assumptions.
- Explored **longevity risk transfer tools** such as longevity bonds, swaps, and reinsurance.
- Evaluated **regulatory frameworks** (e.g. RBA in Kenya) and suggested reforms for better oversight and resilience.

## 📊 Key Methods & Models

- **Survival analysis**
- **Mortality projection**
- **Life expectancy modeling**
- **Scenario planning and stress testing**
- **Policy review and financial instrument evaluation**

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- R (for mortality modeling and statistical analysis)
- Excel (data cleaning, survival tables, visualizations)
- Actuarial functions (life tables, annuity values, etc.)

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Kenyan pension schemes face increasing longevity pressure due to rising life expectancy and non-communicable diseases.
- Mortality models such as Lee-Carter and CBD are effective in forecasting trends but must be locally calibrated.
- Risk transfer instruments (e.g. longevity swaps) offer potential but require regulatory support.
- Proactive policy intervention is necessary to protect both retirees and pension providers.
